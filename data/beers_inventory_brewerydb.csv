"8II2YO","Brooklyn Pilsner","Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New Yorks pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the worlds most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. Germangrown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.","75","Pilsner","Pilsner","","1","Year Round","N"

"i2RMeq","UFO Hefeweizen","UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer.

Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.			
The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast's fruity	 tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing	 light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens UFO does not have the spicy tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.

"GyhwBd","Humming Ale","This bold, frothy, effervescent ale, with hints of citrus, finds its name throughout English literature that might just as well describe its taste, its history, or just how it makes you feel.

The recipe for Humming  Ale and its resulting flavor, owe much to the traditional methods used to make our Liberty Ale. Both are brewed using pale malt, a natural carbonation process called bunging, and dry-hopping, but the unique flavor profile of Humming comes from a distinctive hop from New Zealand called Nelson Sauvin.

Humming is an ancient beer term, found everywhere from Robin Hood to Herman Melville, used to describe a strong, effervescent ale with a lot of character or just in praise of a truly good beer. Originally created to celebrate our 30th anniversary of our Mariposa Street location, it is now available each July  November, Humming has quickly become a classic that lives up to its name.

"Uiol9p","Anchor Steam","Anchor Steam Beer owes its deep amber color, thick, creamy head, and rich, distinctive flavor to a brewing process like none other.

It is a process that combines deep respect for brewing tradition with many decades of evolution to arrive at a unique approach: a blend of pale and caramel malts, fermentation with lager yeast at warmer ale temperatures in shallow open-air fermenters, and gentle carbonation in our cellars through an all-natural process called krausening.

Anchor Steam Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when steam was a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Franciscos rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name steam is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Franciscos original Anchor Steam Beer.

The yeast used during fermentation produces many of Liberty Ale's subtle flavors and characteristics. A natural process called ""bunging"" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.

Liberty Ale was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Reveres historic ride. As the first modern American IPA brewed after prohibition and the first modern American single-hop ale and dry-hopped ale, Anchors Liberty Ale is the original craft brewed ale and the beer that started a revolution.","25","Pint","Pint","http://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/5ZeTFl/upload_3sVpMj-large.png","1","Year Round","N"

"3RFxH6","Finestkind IPA","Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think theyll be quite pleased.","30","Pint","Pint","http://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3RFxH6/upload_ChVh6v-large.png","1","Year Round","N"

The fellows up in the Northwest kept calling for more hops! Soon it became a common theme across the land. Rangers, fans and craft lovers everywhere were searching for hoppier beers. 

So, here it finally is, New Belgium's foray into the true American India Pale Ales. Bring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor.
