Freedom from the notion that IPAs should only assail you with bitterness. And from the idea that a big, balanced, hoppy beer can't possibly come in a can. We believe that those who have tasted freedom shall forever brew free. Celebrating the right to be original. To us, the 21st Amendment means much more than just an end to prohibition. It means the right to brew beer, the freedom to be innovative, and the obligation to have fun. When we opened the 21st Amendment brewpub in San Francisco, we vowed to do things differently: Shaun O'Sullivan; Nico Freccia. Why cans? A Six-Pack of Good Reasons: 1. Cans use less energy to produce, to transport and to chill. 2. Cans are easier to recycle and recycled more often than glass. 3. Exposure to light ruins a good beer - cans keep the light out and the good in. 4. Cans are lined so they don't affect the flavor of the beer. 5. Feel that? Cans weigh less than glass. 6. Cans go where glass is banned - pool's, beaches, boats, gold courses, stadiums, parks. Some of our favorite beers never seem to make it out of the brewpub. Stop by next time you're in San Francisco's soma district and see what's on tap. 70 IBUs. 7% alc./vol.",859612001031American Wheat or Rye Beer,21st Amendment Brewery,Hell Or High Watermelon,"Seasonal release.

AleSmith Anvil Ale is a traditional English-style ESB (Extra Special Bitter). Although the flavor is not particularly bitter, the name refers to the times when there were Porters and Stouts (very dark, usually sweet ales) and there were Bitters (lighter, drier, and a bit more hoppy). We brew our award-winning ESB using only premium-quality malts and the freshest hops, and ferment it with our championship yeast strain. Even the water we use is precisely conditioned to match the famous waters of Burton-on-Trent, England, home of some of the most savory ales in the world. The brewer's yeast in the bottom of the bottle is living proof that this is a top-quality bottle-conditioned beer. Conditioning in the bottle gives the beer a lush, velvety texture that you just can't get with force-carbonating.

True Arrogant Bastards know that this could not be further from the truth. The real beauty, richness and depth in life can only be found if the journey through life itself is looked upon as a constant chance to learn, live and find life's passion.

Bottle conditioned. The Moortgat family brewery. Refreshing and golden like a Pilsner, but with the flavor, depth and complexity of an ale, this Belgian favorite has been brewed by four generations of the Moortgat family. The Pilsner malts, Bohemian hops and unique yeast strain combine to create Duvel's intensity, aroma and oomph. And the unusually long maturation process at our brewery ensures a mellow, balanced and beguiling flavor. - Moortgat Family. Duvel. Different for a reason. 1. Weird looking: Shaped to release the beer's abundant aromas, the Duvel glass allows the beer to slip under our distinctive head, and onto your expectant taste buds. 2. Vertically challenged: Duvel's bottle is short and stubby, and made from heavy-weight glass to withstand pressure created by bottle fermentation. The brown glass prevents UV damage. 3. Respect your elders: This Belgian classic brings forth brewing methods and standards that have operated at our Breendonk brewery since 1871. 4. Pale but interesting: Behind Duvel's golden hues and refreshing taste is a deep, complex and intriguing ale with big flavor. 5. Guaranteed not fresh: Duvel is fermented 3 times. Why? Flavor, depth, complexity and character. Everything you look for in a new acquaintance! 6. Big headed, but humble: Created by champagne-like bubbles mingling with proteins formed during the malting process, the luxuriant head is Duvel's distinctive calling card. Four generations of the Moortgat Family have brought together Pilsner malts, Bohemian hops, and a unique yeast strain to create this intense, aromatic and beguiling ale.

Very quickly it resurfaced in the most wondrous of ways. After her prayers had been answered she blessed the pond and valley. Later, she had an abbey built there. Today they brew beer and while we were traveling in Belgium we stopped in, heard the story and tried the beer. Really good beer and a great story. Of course, we wanted to share what we'd heard and tasted. Usually we'd do that over beers. This time we did it with a beer. Recreating that experience wasn't easy.
